				 Some things about me, I am a musician focused mainly in hip-hop with inspiration of heavy metal and dubstep influences.
			</p>
			<p>
				 I have been a gamer for as long as I can remember and would assume most of my classmates are aware of my affinity for the Legend of Zelda franchise.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am also the brave owner of a Shiba Inu puppy named Winter; infamous for pulling too hard on his leash, chewing on things he is not supposed to, and jumping on everyone he meets (which is not normal shiba behavior).
